## Deviations from OpenClaw

IronClaw intentionally differs from OpenClaw in these ways:

1. **Rust vs TypeScript**: Native performance, memory safety, single binary distribution
2. **WASM sandbox vs Docker**: Lighter weight, faster startup, capability-based security
3. **PostgreSQL vs SQLite**: Better suited for production deployments
4. **NEAR AI focus**: Primary provider with session-based auth
5. **No mobile/desktop apps**: Focus on server-side and CLI initially
6. **WASM channels**: Novel extension mechanism not in OpenClaw

These are intentional architectural choices, not gaps to be filled.
